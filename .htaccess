To directly serve your website from the `public` directory, use the following `.htaccess` configuration:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On

    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$1 [L]
</IfModule>
```

This configuration will internally redirect all requests to the `public` directory, allowing you to access your website's `index.php` (or `index.html`) directly.
